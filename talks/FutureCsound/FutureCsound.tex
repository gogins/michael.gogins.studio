\begin{frame}{What Csound Is}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item     
            To summarize for clarity: \textit{Csound is a sound programming 
language and sound processing system}.
        \item
            Csound is used mainly for making computer music, but other 
uses include data sonification, audio in computer games, 
education, \textit{etc.}, perhaps more in future.
        \item
            All functionality is available in the Csound shared 
libary, with interfaces to standard programming languages.
        \item
            Csound runs on standard operating systems, \textit{and on the Web}.
        \item
            Csound is old, going back to 1985, and has a long tradition with a 
large body of works that still run thanks to backwards compatibility.
        \item 
           \textit{ Csound is open source}.
    \end{itemize}    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What Csound Could Be}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textit{Software fragments}. Csound could unify the world of 
music programming by serving as a standard sound engine. Not likely but the 
closer the better.
        \item \textit{Music fragments}. Csound could serve as a \textit{lingua 
franca} for computer music. Not likely but the closer the 
better.
        \item Other systems vie for this role, notably:
            \begin{description}
             \item[Max] Widely taught because widely used for 
commercial sound design.
             \item[SuperCollider] Has a younger hipper community.
             \item[WebAudio] Unit generator synthesis in standard 
HTML5. May become more important.
            \end{description}
        \item But Csound is the most powerful, and has advantages for the 
future, such as multi-threading and an existing WebAssembly build.
    \end{enumerate}    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
    \frametitle<presentation>{Problems}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item     
            The Csound language is still clunky and lacks useful features such 
as structures, classes, and closures.
        \item
            The Csound infrastructure is not complete on all platforms.
        \item
            The Csound API is not consistent on all platforms, especially 
HTML5.
        \item
            The Csound build has a lot of external dependencies.
        \item
            We need more developers who understand the system.
    \end{enumerate}    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
    \frametitle<presentation>{Solutions}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item     
            Add structures, classes, and closures to the Csound language.
        \item
            Build all releases using online continuous integration systems.
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item That means using a package manager or automated 
builds for all third party dependencies.
                \item
                    When that's working, simplify the build system.
                \item
                    When that works, write scripts to do local builds.
                \item
                    \textit{This now exists for Windows with Visual Studio.}
                \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
    \frametitle<presentation>{Further Out}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item     
            Try to get Csound to become an international standard. SAOL and 
SASL were a stab in this direction that failed due to lack of a performant 
reference implementation. Csound is performant enough. Not \textit{all} of 
Csound needs to be in such a standard.
        \item
            Consider exposing Csound opcodes via WebAssembly as WebAudio unit 
generators.
        \item 
            Make a WebAssembly-based showcase for Csound examples with a 
real ``Wow!'' factor. Google's 
\href{https://experiments.withgoogle.com/chrome}{Chrome Experiments} and the 
\href{https://www.shadertoy.com/}{Shadertoy} website are models.
    \end{enumerate}    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
    \frametitle<presentation>{Recruiting Developers}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item     
            Follow through on CI-oriented build systems for OS X and Linux. Cut 
down the overhead of getting Csound building!
        \item   
            Maynooth might be a template, consider working with teachers in 
computer music courses who for various reasons might be amenable to typing 
code instead of eating Max spaghetti.
        \item   
            Could this work together with Google Summer of Code?
        \item   
            Could people volunteer to help actual composers who might be 
interested in using Csound but are scared of the learning curve?
    \end{enumerate}    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
    \frametitle<presentation>{For Me Personally}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item     
            For me personally, what I need from Csound is as 
always...
        \item   
            Good stuff I can beg, borrow, or steal.
        \item   
            Fast working speed. I want Csound to be my playpen.
        \item   
            Not so much for sound design as for live performance, I've been 
inspired by watching people patch modular analog synthesizers on stage. 
Something like that would be nice for Csound and then good patches could be 
saved and used in through-composed pieces.
