@MISC{stdstring,

This permits developers to use any number of libraries without worrying whether they have the same names for different things. If library one has a \url{foo} function, and library two also has a \url{foo} function, then if library one is in the \url{one} namespace and library two is in the \url{two} namespace, I can call \url{one::foo()} or \url{two::foo()} and be sure of getting the right function. All declarations in the Standard C++ library are in the \url{std} namespace, and all of the C runtime header files such as \url{stdio.h} have also been brought into the \url{std} namespace, following the pattern of using the \verb|#include <cstdio>| header in place of \verb|#include <stdio.h>|.}

@MISC{stdvector,
note = {The standard C++ library is a \emph{template} library. The collections, algorithms, and streams declared in the library use templates so that they can easily be specialized for any C++ type. For example, \verb|template<typename T> &std::vector<T>::operator[size _t i]| returns a reference to \verb|float| for \verb|std::vector<float>|, and it returns a reference to \verb|std::string| for \verb|std::vector<std::string>|. Furthermore, the standard library carefully separates data from algorithms. Algorithms such as \verb|std::find| are written to work using \emph{iterators} that can be either pointers to elementary types, such as \verb|float *I = &myArray[0]|, or standard library iterators such as \verb|std::vector<float>::iterator it = myVector.begin()|. The meaning of \verb|*i| or \verb|++i| is identical to the meaning of  \verb|*it| or \verb|++it|, so the same template algorithm will work on both types. By separating algorithms from data in this way, the standard library multiplies the number of combinations of data and algorithms that can successfully be used. This is a quite different use of C++ than inheritance.}
