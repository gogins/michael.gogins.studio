## Program Notes

This piece for fixed medium is one in a series of variations on a piece, 
___Poustinia___, that I originally composed for the 2015 International Csound 
Conference in St. Petersburg, Russia. Poustinia is a Russian word that means 
desert, or hermitage.

This piece, like all in this series, is composed using a parametric 
Lindenmayer system that draws a musical score in a chord space, using, 
among other things, operations derived from the Generalized Contextual 
Group of Fiore and Satyendra. All of the sounds are directly synthesized and 
modulated using Csound. The piece is, as it were, algorithmically through 
composed: the generative program runs, and the piece is complete. There is no 
editing the piece except by tinkering with the program.

## Biography

I was born in 1950 in Salt Lake City, Utah, and lived there till 1973, a wonderful place to grow up with many trips to mountains, desert, and unlocked university labs. My father was an inventor, my mother was a fine artist and commercial artist. I have pursued poetry, photography, music performance, and music composition. I have lived in Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, and now New York again. I have a B.A. in comparative religion from the University of Washington, 1984.

At the same time as I was studying comparative religion, I was taking seminars in computer music with John Rahn. Computer music gradually became my major interest. It also enabled me to make a living as a software engineer. In the late 1980s, I benefited greatly from Brad Garton's openness to non-student participation in the woof user group and concerts at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center, now the Columbia Computer Music Center.

Currently, I contribute code to Csound, maintain the vst4cs opcodes for hosting VST plugins in Csound, maintain the Csound for Android app, and maintain the csound-extended package incorporating various facilities for algorithmic composition in JavaScript, C++, and Common Lisp. I write articles and papers and give talks on computer music, and I create computer music. I have a special interest in algorithmic composition. I am currently working to bring new developments in mathematical music theory into algorithmic composition software.  I am married to Heidi Rogers, who before she retired ran Framk Music Company, a classical sheet music store in New York. We live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and in the Catskills.
