Tzimtzum is a term in the Lurianic Kabbalah that refers to the withdrawal of God's infinite light in order to make room for the created cosmos. In our world, God is present only in the form of absence, and the natural world evolves in the form of autonomous processes.

I chose __**Tzimtzum**__ as the name of this album to reflect the fact that all of its music has been composed using generative processes. Although I have created these processes,they are autonomous in the sense that, when I render a piece, I run the program and when it is finished, the piece is complete, as a high-resolution soundfile. Each piece is defined by a single, self-contained computer program. I do not edit the resulting soundfiles in any way. If I need to improve the piece, I edit its code and run it again.
    
Some of the generative processes in these pieces are Lindenmayer systems, and some of them are recurrent iterated function systems. I have written the code for these processes as part of my Silence project, which is open source software that can be downloaded from my csound-extended project on GitHub. In the cases of both Lindenmayer systems and iterated function systems, the generative processes operate in a space that represents both notes and chords. To generate and transform chords, I use some results from mathematical music theory, especially the chord space of Dmitri Tymoczko and the generalized contextual group of Fiore and Satyendra. For rendering the generated scores, I use exclusively Csound. All of the sounds, without exceptions, are synthesized. No samples are used. The piano sound is the Pianoteq physically modeled piano, and the organ sound is the Aeolus software pipe organ.
