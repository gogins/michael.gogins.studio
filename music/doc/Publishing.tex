I have produced a number of works that deserve to be published. They mostly are works of fixed media electroacoustic music performed in festivals and conferences, or prepared for such performance. There also are some writings and some videos, and may be other things in the future, especially photographs. I need to move ahead with publishing these works. For the time being, that will mean uploading my works to YouTube, CDBaby, SoundCloud, my own Web site, and other venues for online distribution. These are the steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Of course, identify which works I wish to publish and ensure they are finished! I have written a Python script \texttt{create\_complete\_playlist.py} that searches my hard disk for soundfiles and compiles both a Windows playlist and a tab-delimited table of pieces.
\item Make sure the finished works are, where possible, tagged with name, title, copyright notice, and other data. I will create a script for this.
\item Register those works with the United States Copyright Office at: \url{https://eco.copyright.gov/eService_enu/}. I have made sure I can log in.
\item Register the same works with ASCAP at: \url{https://www.ascap.com/member-access/}. I have made sure I can log in.
\item Create a YouTube channel for myself, when I monetize my uploads I get all the ad revenue directly from YouTube. I have made sure I have a channel and I can log into it. I may need to make sure I have payment arranged.
\item Register the same works with a content identification service according to ASCAP's instructions: \url{https://www.ascap.com/help/royalties-and-payment/make-money-youtube}. But CDBaby already does this for me. I have made sure I can log in to CDBaby at \url{https://members.cdbaby.com/Login.aspx}. CDBaby is still making me a hundredth of a cent every day or so. And they are paying me! I have verified that the direct deposit is happening. I also opted into their YouTube and other media monetization, even though they take a sizeable cut, because it simplifies my life.
\item YouTube's instructions for converting soundfiles to WMV files for upload are here: \url{https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1696878?hl=en}. But CDBaby has done this for me automatically. I will create a script or template or something for making this prettier and easier. Included information should be:
\begin{itemize}
\item Artwork. Might include a sox sonogram.
\item My name.
\item The appropriate URL.
\item Album title, if there is one.
\item Title of the piece.
\item Duration of the piece.
\item Comments, if any.
\end{itemize}
\noindent How much of this can be in tags? Current standard tags are \url{http://id3.org/id3v2.3.0}.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent In sum: I will split doing this myself directly on my channel, to doing it through CDBaby. Pieces on my blog I will usually link to CDBaby or YouTube. The steps are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify on computer and in spreadsheet.
\item Tag. 
\item Apply for copyright.
\item Register with ASCAP.
\item Add new title to CDBaby or upload WMV to my YouTube channel.
\item Post the link to CDBaby or my YouTube channel on my blog.
\end{enumerate}

A mistake I made in the past was deleting my master list. I will just keep adding it to and do a minimal update of status, e.g. published to where, worth publishing, tagged. And the default title is the filename!

I will continue looking for other ways to publish music that will (a) protect my rights, (b) get me a bigger and better audience, and (c) make me money.

I have been urging Heidi to get her demo, which is quite good, online somehow. She needs to get the permissions from the performers before she can follow my path. I will remind her yet again....
