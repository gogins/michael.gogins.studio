I have produced a number of works that deserve to be published. These include albums of fixed media electroacoustic music, as well as music performed in festivals and conferences, or prepared for such performance. There also are some writings and some videos, and may be other things in the future, especially photographs. I need to move ahead with publishing these works. For the time being, that will mean uploading my works to CDBaby or YouTube, with links to Tumblr.

The major issue is that I have published two albums with CDBaby and plan to publish more, but there is some conflict between CDBaby which requires to be the exclusive digital distributor, and my other channels for publication such as SoundCloud, Tumblr, and YouTube. These are the steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item I have verified my accounts with the United States Copyright Office, ASCAP, YouTube, and AdSense. I still need to register with AdRev (update: I have now done so).
\item Of course, identify which works I wish to publish and ensure they are finished! I have written a Python script \texttt{create\_complete\_playlist.py} that searches my hard disk for soundfiles and compiles both a Windows playlist and a tab-delimited table of pieces.
\item Make sure the finished works are, where possible, tagged with name, title, copyright notice, and other data. If possible, I will create a script for this. My earlier approach of doing this at the time of rendering is no longer feasible because I now have too many ways of rendering works.
\item Register those works with the United States Copyright Office at: \url{https://eco.copyright.gov/eService_enu/}. I should copyright  the ``phonorecord'' as registration type SR as well as, at the same time, registering for composition and arrangement copyrights. It is not necessary to deposit a score, the phonorecord suffices. Copyright is \$65 per registration for single works with hard copies. Online it is cheaper. Grouped into albums it is cheaper. Obviously I can only afford the latter.
\item Register the same works with ASCAP at: \url{https://www.ascap.com/member-access/}. 
\item For works that I have not yet published:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Upload works to CDBaby. CDBaby will then promote digital distribution, upload to ``Michael Gogins - Topic'' channel on YouTube, and upload to Amazon.
	\item Link to works on CDBaby from Tumblr, Facebook, etc.
\end{enumerate}
\item For works that I have published somewhere but not with CDBaby:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Register the works with a content identification service according to ASCAP's instructions: \url{https://www.ascap.com/help/royalties-and-payment/make-money-youtube}. 
	\item Convert the works to WMV files for upload to my ``Michael Gogins'' channel, monetized, on YouTube: \url{https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1696878?hl=en}. I will create a script or template or something for making this prettier and easier. Included information should be simply a sox sonogram, labeled with the title of the work and a dated copyright notice, perhaps even a few words of program notes and a link to my blog.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

A mistake I made in the past was deleting my master list. I will just keep adding it to and do a minimal update of status, e.g. published to where, worth publishing, tagged. And the default title is the filename! I should indeed make sure I can find the \emph{Publish} code and soundfiles, but I should \emph{not} worry too much or spend too much time tracking the other stuff.

I will continue looking for other ways to publish music that will (a) protect my rights, (b) get me a bigger and better audience, and (c) make me money.

I have been urging Heidi to get her demo, which is quite good, online somehow. She needs to get the permissions from the performers before she can follow my path. I will identify just what needs to be done. If that is too much, perhaps she can make a new demo where she plays, or where she gets the paperwork done for her players. I will remind her yet again....

\subsection*{2016 December 5}

I have finished my spreadsheet and am almost done listening to all the pieces, but it is clear that this is only a first step in evaluating these works. I will need to group them into albums and then listen to many of them again. For example, there are way too many similar ``IFS'' or ``sound fractal'' pieces. There should be an album of these containing only the best ones, even if it is short or long.

Two preliminary thoughts. The good news: more of these are listenable or even attractive than I thought! The bad news: too much stuff is on the borderline of good and suffers from being too unvarying, or from some fatal and probably avoidable flaw somewhere along the way, or both. I obviously must, must, \emph{must} police the clinkers much more sedulously.

\subsection*{2016 December 6}

I have sifted through the works and ended up with 3.4 hours worth of ``publishable'' stuff. Probably only some of this is really worth publishing. I am throwing stuff out that is not good enough. I'm keeping track of the works, albums, status, etc.\ in a spreadsheet (\url{file:///D:/msys64/home/restore/michael.gogins.studio/music/doc/Works.ods}) because that is simpler than doing it here.

\subsubsection{2016 December 9}

I've finished the spreadsheet including adding times, grouping works into albums, detecting and removing redundant works, and so on. There are still 3.4 hours. I will publish \emph{\textbf{Summertrees}} and \emph{\textbf{Sound Fractals}} as albums on CDBaby. \emph{\textbf{Blue and Yellow Leaves}}, \emph{\textbf{Sevier}}, and \emph{\textbf{The Garden of the Hesperides}} will have to be published directly on YouTube. The \emph{\textbf{Garden of Algorithms}} CD ended up with titles in reverse order with respect to the actual tracks. I will reverse that here, but I'm not sure what to do about that with CDBaby.

\subsubsection*{2016 December 10}

I must still tag, normalize, and video-ize works. Note that CDBaby distributes only CD quality audio and prefers that format. MP3s can be 128 to 320 kpbs. Google takes MOV, MP4 (MPEG4), AVI, WMV, FLV, 3GP, MPEGPS, and WebM and prefers AAC audio encoding. So the workflow, which I can automate based on my spreadsheet, is:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Create a normalized master soundfile from the original output soundfile, with the original resolution.
	\item Create a CD quality WAV soundfile from the master soundfile, normalized and tagged, for CDBaby. 
	\item Create a 128 kpbs MP3 from the master soundfile, tagged, for copyright and ASCAP.
	\item Create a spectrogram with metadata in labels from the master soundfile, for YouTube.
	\item Create an MP4 file at the highest permissible resolution with an image from the master soundfile and the spectrogram, tagged, for YouTube.
\end{itemize}

\noindent I have created a \texttt{process\_masters.py} script to automate the above steps, taking a text database of works and producing all files in one directory.

\subsubsection*{2016 December 11}

I have registered all outstanding works with ASCAP, applied for copyright for \emph{\textbf{Semblance}}, and uploaded all non-CDBaby works to YouTube and AdRev for monetization with some minor variations in types of ads. The processing script took two days to write, but ended up saving me just oodles of work.

I now need to submit \emph{\textbf{Summertrees}} and \emph{\textbf{Sound Fractals}} as albums on CDBaby. I will then be completely caught up with the publication side of things.

\subsubsection*{2016 December 12}

I have (almost but not quite) finished uploading and registering all outstanding non-CDBaby works. There is a question about CDBaby registering some works with ASCAP, which I must investigate.

I am researching how to publish CDs on CDBaby, if it is possible simply to upload the tracks, or if I need an ISO and a cover, or if I need to send physical CDs. Update: I have decided to upload albums for digital distribution only. I may do differently next time, but this will get me caught up.

Then I just need to edit all my links on Tumblr.

It seems I can't embed my entire channel, but it's easy to embed individual videos of my works.

Got CD Baby Pro for \emph{\textbf{Summertrees}}. I have done just YouTube for \emph{\textbf{Sound Fractals}}.
