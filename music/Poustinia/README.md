# Program Notes for ICMC-NYCEMF 2019

## Poustinia v2

This piece was composed in 2015 using the JavaScript programming language with my Silencio algoriothmic composition library. The piece is based on a Lindenmayer system that writes a score in chord space with voice-leading operations. I synthesized the music using Csound. The piece has an HTML graphical user interface that I used to display the generated score, and to fine-tune the levels and sounds of the Csound instruments.

This piece was composed in 2003 using the Python programming language with my CsoundAC algorithmic composition library. The piece is based on a set of discrete dynamical systems with strange attractors, which generate sequences of notes that are fitted to a predetermined chord progression. I synthesized the music using Csound.

# Biography

I was born in 1950 in Salt Lake City, Utah, and lived there till 1973, a wonderful place to grow up with many trips to mountains, desert, and unlocked university labs. My father was an inventor, my mother was a fine artist and commercial artist. I have pursued poetry, photography, music performance, and music composition. I have lived in Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, and now New York again. I have a B.A. in comparative religion from the University of Washington, 1984.

At the same time as I was studying comparative religion, I was taking seminars in computer music with John Rahn. Computer music gradually became my major interest. It also enabled me to make a living as a software engineer. In the late 1980s, I benefited greatly from Brad Garton’s openness to non-student participation in the woof user group and concerts at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center, now the Columbia Computer Music Center.

Currently, I contribute code to Csound, maintain the vst4cs opcodes for hosting VST plugins in Csound, maintain the Csound for Android app, and maintain the csound-extended package incorporating various facilities for algorithmic composition in JavaScript, C++, and Common Lisp. I write articles and papers and give talks on computer music, and I create computer music. I have a special interest in algorithmic composition. I am currently working to bring new developments in mathematical music theory into algorithmic composition software.  I am married to Heidi Rogers, who before she retired ran Framk Music Company, a classical sheet music store in New York. We live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and in the Catskills.
