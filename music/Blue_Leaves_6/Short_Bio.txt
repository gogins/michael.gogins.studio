I was born in 1950 in Salt Lake City, Utah, and lived there till 1973, a wonderful place to grow up with many trips to mountains, desert, and unlocked university labs. My father was an inventor, my mother was a fine artist and commercial artist. I have pursued poetry, photography, music performance, and music composition. I have lived in Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, and now New York again. I have a B.A. in comparative religion from the University of Washington, 1984.

At the same time as I was studying comparative religion, I was taking seminars in computer music with John Rahn. Computer music gradually became my major interest. It has also enabled me to make a living as a software engineer. In the late 1980s, I benefited greatly from Brad Garton’s openness to non-student participation in the woof user group and concerts at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center, now the Columbia Computer Music Center.

Currently, I contribute code to Csound, am the author of its algorithmic composition system, maintain its Windows version, and host the New York Csound Users Group. I write articles and papers on computer music, and I create computer music. I have a special interest in algorithmic composition. I am currently working to bring new developments in mathematical music theory into algorithmic composition software.  I am married to Heidi Rogers, who owns a classical sheet music store in New York. We live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and in the Catskills.
