## Program Notes

This piece is the final version of a rather extended struggle with the initial version. All versions are written in C++, generated algorithmically using basically the same recurrent iterated function system, and rendered using Csound. The final version uses a different method of generating the harmony based on the [generalized contextual group](http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.05.11.3/mto.05.11.3.fiore_satyendra.pdf) of neo-Reimannian chord transformations, and applies some hand-coded tweaks to the dynamics and the ranges of some of the instruments.

## Biography

I was born in 1950 in Salt Lake City, Utah, and lived there till 1973, a wonderful place to grow up with many trips to mountains, desert, and unlocked university labs. My father was an inventor, my mother was a fine artist and commercial artist. I have pursued poetry, photography, music performance, and music composition. I have lived in Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, and now New York again. I have a B.A. in comparative religion from the University of Washington, 1984.

At the same time as I was studying comparative religion, I was taking seminars in computer music with John Rahn. Computer music gradually became my major interest. It also enabled me to make a living as a software engineer. In the late 1980s, I benefited greatly from Brad Garton's openness to non-student participation in the woof user group and concerts at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center, now the Columbia Computer Music Center.

Currently, I contribute code to Csound, maintain the vst4cs opcodes for hosting VST plugins in Csound, maintain the Csound for Android app, and maintain the csound-extended package incorporating various facilities for algorithmic composition in JavaScript, C++, and Common Lisp. I write articles and papers and give talks on computer music, and I create computer music. I have a special interest in algorithmic composition. I am currently working to bring new developments in mathematical music theory into algorithmic composition software.  I am married to Heidi Rogers, who before she retired ran Framk Music Company, a classical sheet music store in New York. We live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and in the Catskills.
