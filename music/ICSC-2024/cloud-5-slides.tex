\begin{frame}{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item cloud-5 is a new system for composing, performing, and publishing computer music. 
\item In this talk, I focus on my motivations for creating cloud-5.
\item And I show how cloud-5 accommodates composing, performing, and publishing in one environment. 
\item Details on the implementation may be found in the paper presented in this conference, and especially in the \href{https://github.com/gogins/cloud-5}{cloud-5 GitHub repository}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Motivations}

\begin{frame}{Motivations}
\begin{itemize}
\item My primary motivation is to make the kind of music that I would like to hear, but nobody else seems to be making, by means of algorithmic composition and synthesis.
\item As I wander down this thorny path, I find myself wanting to perform some pieces live.
\item I also find myself wanting to make some pieces that play indefinitely, that are "always on."
\item And to generate visuals \emph{from} my pieces, or to transform visuals \emph{into} pieces.
\item And to drastically simplify the publication of my pieces.
\item And to drastically simplify the infrastructure for doing all of this.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Publication}
\begin{itemize}
\item The record business is dying...
\item ...but at the same time, it has become easier and easier to publish music on the World Wide Web.
\item Such music can be streamed from files -- or it can be Web pages that actually generate music in real time.
\item Doing pieces as Web pages makes it possible to use all the resources of contemporary Web browsers.
\item Within its security sandbox, a browser is basically an operating system plus a game engine plus a high-resolution media player.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{New possibilities}
\begin{itemize}
\item I call music that is played by Web pages on the World Wide Web \emph{cloud music} because it exists only in the cloud, the omnipresent computing infrastructure of the World Wide Web.
\item I feel it is very important to grasp that cloud music is essentially \emph{a new medium for music} and as such,\emph{ it offers new possibilities of musical expression}.
\begin{itemize}
\item A piece can play forever.
\item A piece can generate visuals, or be generated by visuals.
\item A piece can interact with its listeners.
\item Listeners can use a piece to create new pieces.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{New possibilities}
\begin{itemize}
\item cloud-5 is certainly not the first system that publishes music as Web pages on the World Wide Web:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gibber
\item Strudel
\item Csound-IDE
\item ...and others.
\end{itemize}
\item But I think cloud-5 offers a combination of features that support algorithmic composition and synthesis at a high level of power, yet a low overhead of development and maintenance.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Design}

\begin{frame}{Design}
\begin{itemize}
\item A musical composition is a single Web page.
\item The score, the orchestra for performing the score, and all required libraries are embedded in that single Web page.
\item The libraries, any musical assets, and all other pre-requisites are \emph{static resources} on the server filesystem.
\item Writing a piece is done using a text editor.
\item A build system is not used.
\item All this means, thanks to the versionless nature of Internet protocols and Web browsers, that cloud-5 pieces will last forever.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Implementation}
\begin{frame}{Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
\item cloud-5 is a combination of existing systems:
\begin{itemize}
\item The sound processing language Csound, compiled from C to WebAssembly.
\item The live coding system Strudel, written in JavaScript.
\item The algorithmic composition system CsoundAC, compiled from C++ to WebAssembly.
\item GLSL shaders.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Composing}
\begin{itemize}
\item A piece is a single Web page constructed from custom HTML elements that are defined in \texttt{cloud-5.js}.
\item A high-level menu system provides the shell for a piece.
\item The design is modular. Components can be omitted or added. A naming convention makes it clear what the composer can add to the shell in order to make an actual piece.
\item An extension for Visual Studio code makes it possible to edit Csound, Strudel, HTML, and JavaScript code in a piece, and immediately serve that piece in a local Web server to play in the composer's Web browser.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Publishing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Copy your cloud-5 directory to become the root directory in any Web server.
\item Your pieces are, of course, the Web pages in that directory.
\item Modify the index in that directory to list and link to your pieces.
\item Period.
\end{itemize}
