The organizing principle is that each one of my finished pieces will have its own subdirectory here. Each piece will also include all required dependencies if at all possible, either as literals in the code, or as supplemental files. If it is difficult to include dependencies here, they must be freely available on the Internet, e.g. from the `csound-extended` repository.
