This permits you to download these works and share them with others as long as you credit me, but nobody is allowed to change these works in any way, or to use them commercially, without my express written permission. 

The organizing principle is that each one of my pieces will have its own subdirectory here. Each piece will also include all required dependencies if at all possible, either as literals in its source code, or as supplemental files also maintained here. If it is difficult to include dependencies here, they must be freely available on the Internet, e.g. from the `csound-extended` repository.

The `post-process.py` script is designed to translate a single high-resolution soundfile, usually generated by a piece using Csound, to a variety of output formats including an `.mp4` video suitable for uploading to YouTube.
