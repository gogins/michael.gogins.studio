## Biography

I was born in 1950 in Salt Lake City, Utah, and lived there till 1973, with many trips to mountains, desert, and unlocked university labs. My father was an inventor, my mother a fine artist and commercial artist. I have pursued poetry, photography, music performance, and music composition. I have since lived in Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, and now New York again. I have a B.A. in comparative religion from the University of Washington, 1984.

At the same time as I was studying comparative religion, I was taking seminars in computer music with John Rahn. Computer music gradually became my major interest. It also enabled me to make a living as a software engineer. In the late 1980s, I benefited greatly from Brad Garton's openness to non-student participation in the woof user group and concerts at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center.

Currently, I contribute code to Csound, maintain the VST opcodes for hosting VST plugins in Csound, maintain the Csound for Android app, and maintain the csound-extended package incorporating various facilities for algorithmic composition in JavaScript, C++, and Common Lisp. I write articles and papers and give talks on computer music, and I create computer music. I have a special interest in algorithmic composition. I am currently working to bring new developments in mathematical music theory into algorithmic composition software.  I am married to Heidi Rogers, who before she retired ran Framk Music Company, a classical sheet music store in New York. We live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and in the Catskills.

## Blue Leaves (von Reusner) 2

This piece is written in C++, generated algorithmically using a recurrent iterated function system, and rendered using Csound. The final version uses a method of generating harmony based on the [generalized contextual group](http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.05.11.3/mto.05.11.3.fiore_satyendra.pdf) of neo-Reimannian chord transformations, and applies some hand-coded tweaks to the dynamics and the ranges of some of the instruments.

## IFS Study Number 6

This piece is written in Csound using opcodes by me that enable embedding C++ and HTML in Csound, as well as VST plugins and the Csound plugins for embedding the Faust digital signal processing language in Csound. The score is generated using the multiple copy reducing machine algorithm for recurrent iterated function systems.

## Porphyry v7.4.2

This piece is written in Python and rendered using Csound. The conceit of the piece is that the actual measures from Mozart's musical dice game are used as motival cells, played in sequence a random number of times as in Terry Riley's "In C." Additionally, chord progressions and modulations for these motival cells are generated at random using my code for ideas of Dmitri Tymoczko.

## Three Trees 1

This piece is written in Java and rendered using Csound. The score is generated using a Lindenmayer system.
