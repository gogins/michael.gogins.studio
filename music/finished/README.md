# Music by <a href="https://michaelgogins.tumblr.com">Michael Gogins</a>

This directory contains all of my recent works of computer music, mostly 
algorithmically composed, that I consider "finished" in the senses that:

 - They are good enough that I, and at least some others, will enjoy hearing 
   them.

 - I have not been able to improve them.

 - I have rendered them to high-resolution audio, inspected and auditioned 
   them, and have found no obvious audio artifacts.

The following is required of all pieces that I maintain here:

 - Each piece is stored in its own subdirectory.

 - The title of the piece is identical to the filename of the piece's source 
   code file without its filename extension, is identical to the name of the 
   output soundfile without its filename extension, is identical to the name 
   of the subdirectory containing the piece. This is to prevent any further 
   unfortunate incidents of the sort in which I have a very nice soundfile of 
   a piece, but I can't find the source code that produced the piece.

 - If at all possible the pathname of the composition source code file is 
   embedded in the output soundfile metadata.

 - "Liner notes," composer information, instructions for performers, and other 
   such documentation is embedded im the source code file, or kept as a 
   README.md file in the composition subdirectory.

 - Output soundfiles are not added to the GitHub repository, but it is 
   required that they can be produced by executing the composition file.

 - Dependencies for the composition code must be kept to a minimum, and 
   consist of open source code as far as possible. Proprietary software is 
   permitted if and only if it is both highly superior and widely used (e.g., 
   Modartt's Pianoteq VST3 plugin, the Reaper digital audio workstation).

 - In some cases, a piece requires a specific software environment, notably my 
   cloud-5 project, to run. In such cases, the user must create a symbolic 
   link in the cloud-5 directory (or other environment) to the source code 
   file stored here, and execute that piece in the cloud-5 directory (or other 
   environment).
