## Notes

I composed this piece using a Lindenmayer system operating in chord space and 
applying actions from the generalized contextual group of Fiore and Satyendra, 
thus creating a varied harmonic progression that is almost but not really 
tonal. The code for this piece runs as a Python action in Reaper, and 
generates a MIDI track that is rendered with a variety of Pianoteq presets and 
other plugins. This piece was premiered 26 June 2025 at the New York City 
Electroacoustic Music Festival.
