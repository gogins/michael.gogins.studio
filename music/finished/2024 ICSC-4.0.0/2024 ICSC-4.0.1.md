## Notes

This is a cloud-5 piece that I performed live at the 2024 International Csound Conference in Vienna. Cloud-5 pieces are rendered in the user's Web browser based on code served from a local or remote Web server. The cloud-5 system includes a WebAssembly build of Csound, and the WebAssembly-based live coding environment Strudel, both of which are used in this piece, along with custom code for algorithmic composition using CsoundAC and/or Strudel, and synthesis using Csound.

This particular rendering of _2024 ICSC_ is the preview that I made for submission to the ICSC by performing the piece at home, doing live coding during the performance based on controls built into the piece.

You can perform this piece yourself [here](https://gogins.github.io/2024-ICSC.html). Use the "Composition" sliders in the "Controls" menu.

The piece cuts off suddenly because the piece has a preconfigured duration of 6 minutes, and that's just where the piece turned itself off.
