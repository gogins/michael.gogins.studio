Code for a genetic algorithm solution to the
traveling salesman problem, inspired by the
treatment in Dewdney's THE NEW TURING OMNIBUS,
Computer Science Press, W.H. Freeman and Company,
1993, p. 106.

NOTE: The purpose of this code is to demonstrate
genetic algorithms, NOT to make the genetic
solution to the traveling salesman problem as
efficient as possible. Several features of this
code -- e.g. the mapping to city names -- are
real time-wasters if you're looking for
short run-times.

Tours are represented as lists of "removal" 
numbers. For example, if the list of cities
is (a b c d e f) then (2 3 1 3 1 1) represents
the tour (b d a f c e):

                                    TOUR
start w/std sequence: a b c d e f
remove item 2:        a c d e f     b
remove item 3:        a c e f       b d
remove item 1:        c e f         b d a
remove item 3:        c e           b d a f
remove item 1:        e             b d a f c
remove item 1:                      b d a f c e
