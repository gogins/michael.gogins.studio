Part of Silencio, an HTML5 algorithmic music composition library for Csound.

This file implements Koenig tendency masks with some extensions. A tendency 
mask is an envelope for the boundaries of a random variable, which is sampled 
to generate parameters for musical events.

The user must specify a Csound instrument and pfields, a random number generator 
(or indeed any function that can be sampled), the top and bottom envelopes within 
which the samples are rescaled, and the sample count, stride, and time step.

The mask may be used to generate a series of samples over an interval, 
normally time, or to modify one or another field of the events in a 
Silencio score.
