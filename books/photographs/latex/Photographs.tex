These images are all in natural color. They are all shot as far as possible without image manipulation; in a few cases, I have leveled horizons or removed spots. I shoot in JPEG rather than RAW. Selected metadata from the photographs is printed. If the photograph is a digital scan of a 35 mm slide, the creation date is the date of that scan. Captions are sporadic and cryptic, to say the least.

All pictures are included in the full resolution with which they were taken. Thus, you can zoom into any image to see more detail. Pictures copied out of this book will also be in full resolution.

I invite the reader to copy pictures out of this book for printing and viewing, but not for commercial use or re-publication.
