## Live Talks

Here are some presentation slides from talks on computer music that I have given, or plan to give. These slides are viewable in Web browsers. I call them "live talks" because the slides contain Csound pieces that run in the browser without any external software being required.

### [Algorithmic Composition](https://gogins.github.io/michael.gogins.studio/live_talks/algorithmic_composition.html) 

Slides from a talk about algorithmic composition that I gave at the National University of Quilmes in Buenos Aires.

### [Csound and HTML5](https://gogins.github.io/michael.gogins.studio/live_talks/csound_with_html5.html)

Slides from a talk about my implementation of csound.node, my build of Csound for WebAssembly, and my Csound for Android app.

## External Resources

Many of these works use Csound and extensions of Csound. These can be found in the open source [csound-extended repository](https://github.com/gogins/csound-extended).

## Guiding Principles

Now, to head off my recurrent distraction from composing by taking on programming projects, I am renewing my focus on the following principles:

* I need to focus on composing both out of time and in time, and on visual music.

* Simple but deep algorithms are better than powerful but complex algorithms.

* For this reason I should renew my focus on parametric composition.

* I should more deeply investigate interpolations in parametric maps, and genetic algorithms, on the parameters of such systems.

* "Simpler but deep," with visual music, could mean sampling a visual animation to produce a score, as with _**Scrims**_, or transforming a sequence of notes into a visual abstraction (not an image of the score). The former is probably preferable, especially if the sampled points are visually indicated.
