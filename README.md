This is my private Git repository, intended to serve as my creative studio for computer music and other projects. All materials found herein are copyright by Michael Gogins, and are not open source or public domain, unless expressly stated otherwise.

## Methodology

My open source toolkit code and other resources for computer music, including some example pieces, may be found at https://github.com/gogins/gogins.github.io. In general, pieces that use Silencio from gogins.github.io should be created in a subdirectory of studio with a symbolic link to gogins.github.io/csound/silencio. Alternatively, just copy the silencio directory of gogins.github.io.

## Guiding Principles

I have benefitted from using Csound since about 1989, and from becoming a contributor to and maintainer of Csound. I have succeeded in creating a "playpen" for computer music composition, currently found in gogins.github.io, and perhaps soon to be translated to WebAssembly. Now, to head off my recurrent distraction from composing by taking on programming projects, I am renewing my focus on the following principles:

* I need to focus on composing both out of time and in time, and on visual music.

* Simple but deep algorithms are better than powerful but complex algorithms.

* For this reason I should renew my focus on parametric composition.

* I should more deeply investigate interpolations in parametric maps, and genetic algorithms, on the parameters of such systems.

* "Simpler but deep," with visual music, could mean sampling a visual animation to produce a score, as with _**Scrims**_, or transforming a sequence of notes into a visual abstraction (not an image of the score). The former is probably preferable, especially if the sampled points are visually indicated.
