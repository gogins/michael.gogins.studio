This is my private Git repository, intended to serve as my creative studio for computer music and other projects. All materials found herein are copyright by Michael Gogins, and are not open source or public domain, unless expressly stated otherwise.

## Methodology

My open source toolkit code and other resources for computer music, including some example pieces, may be found at https://github.com/gogins/gogins.github.io. That repository is duplicated herein. It is not a submodule or a subtree; once the studio repository is cloned, go into it and clone https://github.com/gogins/gogins.github.io.git. After that, never add any files from studio/gogins.github.io to the studio repository.

In general, pieces that use Silencio or other resources in gogins.github.io should be created in a subdirectory of studio with a symbolic link to gogins.github.io/csound, and that link should be added to the studio repository.

## Guiding Principles

I have benefitted from using Csound since about 1989, and becoming a contributor to and maintainer of Csound. I have succeeded in creating a "playpen" for computer music composition, currently found in gogins.github.io, and perhaps soon to be translated to WebAssembly. Now, to head off my recurrent distraction from composing by taking on programming projects, I must renew my focus on the following principles:

* Simple but deep algorithms are better than powerful but complex algorithms.

* For this reason I should renew my focus on parametric composition.

* I should perhaps investigate interpolations and genetic algorithms on the parameters of such systems.

* I need to focus on composing both out of time and in time, and on visual music.

* Simpler and deeper with visual music could mean sampling a visual animation to produce a score, as with _Scrims_, or transforming a sequence of notes into a visual abstraction (not an image of the score). The former is probably preferable.
