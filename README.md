## Online Compositions

I am publishing here a number of online compositions of visual music, interactive music, and straight ahead electroacoustic music. These are compositions that you can play right here from your Web browser with high-resolution audio using my WebAssembly build of Csound.

Some of these pieces play indefinitely, some accept user interaction, and some just play and stop.

### (Scrims v2)[https://gogins.github.io/csound-extended/scrims.html)

An interactive piece of visual music. The user controls various parameters of Hopalong fractals, how they are mapped to music notes, their chords and chord progressions, and parameters of the Csound instruments.

## Live Talks

These are presentation slides from some talks on computer music that I have given, or plan to give. The slides are viewable in Web browsers. I call these "live talks" because the slides contain Csound pieces that run in the browser (and can be edited in the browser) without any external software being required.

### [Algorithmic Composition](https://gogins.github.io/michael.gogins.studio/live_talks/algorithmic_composition.html) 

Slides from a talk about algorithmic composition that I gave at the National University of Quilmes in Buenos Aires.

### [Csound and HTML5](https://gogins.github.io/michael.gogins.studio/live_talks/csound_with_html5.html)

Slides from a talk about my implementations of csound.node, my build of Csound for WebAssembly, and my Csound for Android app.

## External Resources

Many of these works use Csound and extensions of Csound. These can be found in the open source [csound](https://github.com/csound/csound) and [csound-extended](https://github.com/gogins/csound-extended) GitHub repositories.

## Guiding Principles

Now, to head off my recurrent distraction from composing by taking on programming projects, I am renewing my focus on the following principles:

* I need to focus on composing both out of time and in time, and on visual music.

* Simple but deep algorithms are better than powerful but complex algorithms.

* For this reason I should renew my focus on parametric composition.

* I should more deeply investigate interpolations in parametric maps, and genetic algorithms, on the parameters of such systems.

* "Simpler but deep," with visual music, could mean sampling a visual animation to produce a score, as with _**Scrims**_, or transforming a sequence of notes into a visual abstraction (not an image of the score). The former is probably preferable, especially if the sampled points are visually indicated.
