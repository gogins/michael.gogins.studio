Dear Editors of the Journal of New Music Research,

I am pleased to submit my article, Metamathematics of Algorithmic Composition, for publication in the Journal of New Music Research. This article presents original research. It has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by any other journal. A preprint of the article has been posted on the arXiv.

The paper analyzes not only the philosophical context and fundamental limitations of algorithmic composition—such as uncomputability, excessive complexity, and computability—but also its potential tractability, that is, the feasibility and computational complexity of actually executing certain compositional algorithms.

I consider the Journal of New Music Research an excellent venue for this work due to its interdisciplinary scope, which includes musicology, computer music, and cognition.

I confirm that this manuscript is original, has not been published previously, and is not under review elsewhere. There are no conflicts of interest to declare, and all sources and contributions have been properly acknowledged. I have also prepared an anonymized version of the manuscript for peer review.

Thank you for considering my submission. I would be happy to provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,
Michael Gogins
