\chapter{Introduction}

This book contains my selection of 500 pictures from a lifetime of taking photographs. I have never been a professional, but I was and still am committed to the art of photography. These pictures were variously taken with 35mm film cameras, a variety of digital cameras, and smartphones. They were taken in ny native state of Utah, the state of Washington, California, New York, other states, and various countries around the world. 

I am a ``street photographer`` with an openness to abstraction. My basic aesthetic is to shoot for what catches my eye and to prize beauty. If I photograph people, I often prefer if they don't know it. My reason for doing photography is to see more clearly what God has created.

I have tended to use the sharpest possible camera that is small enough to carry with me at all times. Increasingly, however, I am content with a good smartphone.

As the file size of this book would become unmanageable thanks to the use of uncompressed images, it has been split into a number of volumes.

If I take more pictures that I think are good enough to be in this book, I will add them, and remove as many that are not quite good enough, to keep the total at 500 pictures.

\chapter{Photographs}

These images are all in natural color. They are all shot as far as possible without image manipulation; in a few cases, I have leveled horizons or removed spots. I shoot in JPEG rather than RAW. Selected metadata from the photographs is used for captioning. If the photograph is a digital scan of a 35 mm slide, the creation date is the date of that scan. After the first bit, images do \emph{not} appear in the order taken. The order is more or less random. Captions are sporadic and cryptic, to say the least.

I invite the reader to copy pictures out of this book for printing and viewing, but not for commercial use or re-publication. Pictures copied out of this book will be in the full resolution with which they were taken.
