## Gersen's Model 9B

Jack Vance seems to base his spacecraft on his experience with sailing yachts.

The Model 9B is a small utilitarian starship commonly used by locators, 25 meters long and 5 meters in diameter, semi-streamlined for atmospheric operation and fitted with extensible grey landing feet. Its hull is white to minimize heat transfer, and is streaked with use. The hull is a lifting body with short wings at the middle of the hull. A swivelling rocket/ramjet engine, called a booster, is mounted on each wingtip; the boosters are powered by the energy block and function as turbofans in the atmosphere, and rockets expelling superheated steam in vacuum. There is no rear engine.

Interior compartments are ivory colored, floors are teak, seating is upholstered in leather. From fore to aft the compartments, all on the same deck, all taking the full width of the null, are:

At the bow, a clear nose cone housing the bridge, with the pilot’s chair surrounded by the monitor–autopilot duplex, star-finder, chronometer, macroscope, and manual controls. Behind the pilot are four passenger chairs.

Next is the living cabin, containing a dining table with banquettes that convert to bunks, an air machine, organic reconverter, kitchen counter, informaton bank, and storage compartments, and a small toilet/shower.

Next is the hold, with an airlock with an extensible landing ramp, and a small flying platform for traveling once the Model 9B has landed.

At the stern, there is an engineering compartment containing the energy block, Jarnell intersplit, and additional storage.

## Fantamic Flitterwing

A Fantamic Flitterwing is a luxury space yacht, sometimes armed with projac turrets on top, fore and aft. It is about three times the size of the Model 9B but has a similar interior layout. The complement is up to 12 in six passenger cabins. The standard of interior and exterior finish is high, and so is the standard of performance.

## Projac

A projac is a class of firearm based on the projection of energy, in the form of a beam of high-energy, high-speed, magnetically focussed plasma. The plasma travels at such a high speed that its destructive effects stem from impact and not from temperature. The weapon is powered by a small energy block. A projac resembles an automatic pistol or rifle, but has a small, foward-flaring cone surrounding the muzzle to protect the user, and the barrel has heat-radiating fins. Larger projacs are mounted in turrets on spacecraft. Small-arms projacs are normally aimed with red dot sights. Projacs on spacecraft instead use designating lasers to acquire targets and automatically aim the weapon.

A projac is a class of directed-energy firearm that projects a tightly collimated beam of high-velocity, magnetically focused plasma. Unlike thermal-based energy weapons, the projac’s destructive force results primarily from kinetic impact rather than heat, as the plasma is accelerated to extremely high velocities.

Each shot is powered by a compact energy block, enabling rapid fire without the need for conventional ammunition. Externally, projacs resemble automatic pistols or rifles, but feature a distinctive forward-flaring muzzle cone to shield the user from backscatter and plasma flare. The barrel is lined with radiating fins to dissipate residual heat generated by repeated firing.

Small-arm projacs are typically equipped with red dot reflex sights for intuitive aiming. Larger variants are mounted on spacecraft turrets, where they are controlled via designating lasers that lock onto targets and coordinate automated tracking and firing.
